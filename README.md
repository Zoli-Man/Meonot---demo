# Guest Management System

## Introduction

As a resident of Tel Aviv University dormitories, every time a visitor was coming over I must open a guest request.
The official request form can be quite extensive and somewhat cumbersome to fill out, requiring the visitor's name, phone number, and ID. 
Given the frequent visits from friends and family, I realized that I could streamline this process by creating the Guest Management System.

The Guest Management System is a Python application designed to make visitor management more efficient and user-friendly.
While the application's code is not open-source, my goal is to make it accessible for all fellow dormitory tenants at Tel Aviv University, providing an easy solution for managing and submitting guest requests.

## Key Features

- **Add Guests**: Store visitor details, including their name, phone number, and ID, for future use.

- **Edit Guest List**: Effortlessly manage your list of guests by deleting, switching, or reordering entries as needed.

- **Open Request Form**: Quickly generate a request form with pre-filled guest details, simplifying the process of inviting visitors.
